**ERC20**

Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
For a generic mechanism see {ERC20Mintable}.
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
to implement supply mechanisms].
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
